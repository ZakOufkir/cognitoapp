This project demonstrates how to configure an Amazon Cognito User Pool for user authentication in an application, providing sign-up and sign-in capabilities for users. Additionally, 
it integrates with Amazon Federated Identities to enable users to authenticate using external identity providers (such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon).
